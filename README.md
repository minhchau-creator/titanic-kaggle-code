- WHAT DONE ?
<br>Calling out several classification ML models :
{
    LinearSVC, SVCKNeighborsClassifier,
    LogisticRegression,
    DecisionTreeClassifier,
    RandomForestClassifier,
    ExtraTreesClassifier,
    AdaBoostClassifier,
    XGBClassifier }<br>
<br>
=> Purpose : comparing accuracy between called models => select the most-suited model for the problem<br>
=> understanding the progress of solving a ML-related problem (in this case : classification and make prediction with selected model)<br>
=> get used with pandas, mathplotlib, numpy and seasborn, EDA, visualization numerical data, etc.<br>
<br>
=> RESULT : selected model : Linear Regression , accuracy : ~70% (according to kaggle )
