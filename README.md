# titanic-kaggle-code
- calling out several classification ML models : {
    LinearSVC,
    SVCKNeighborsClassifier,
    LogisticRegression,
    DecisionTreeClassifier
    RandomForestClassifier
    ExtraTreesClassifier,
    AdaBoostClassifier,
    XGBClassifier 
}
=> comparing accuracy between called models => select the most-suited model for the problem
=> understanding the progress of solving a ML-related problem (in this case : classification and make prediction with selected model)
=> get used with pandas, mathplotlib, numpy and seasborn, EDA, visualization numerical data, etc.

=> RESULT : selected model : Linear Regression , accuracy : ~70% (according to kaggle )
